# <div align="center">Implementation of "Prioritization-based delay sensitive task offloading in SDN-integrated mobile IoT network"</div>

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the research paper titled **"A Survey on Deep Learning for Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Vehicle (CAV) Environments"** published in [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574119224000853). The paper explores the use of deep learning techniques in CAV environments to enhance vehicle communication, cooperation, and automation.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of various deep learning models used for vehicle detection, trajectory prediction, and cooperative driving.
- **Simulation Environment**: A simulation environment to test and validate the models.
- **Data Handling**: Preprocessing and handling of data from CAV environments.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `jupyter Notebook`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```
2. Run in Jupyter Notebook
